# Paper Title

This document presents an overview of the various files and materials used during our study. We categorized students into three distinct groups to examine the efficacy of different learning approaches.
* ## [Probability rules](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/PROBABILITY%20RULES.docx)
This document was employed as a resource to assist students in understanding content through two primary approaches: Individual Learning and Teacher-Assisted Learning.
- ## [Matrix](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/Matrix.docx)
This document provides a comprehensive guide on matrices and includes a multiple-choice test based on matrix concepts.
- ## [Test answer key](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/TEST%20ANSWER%20KEY.docx)
This guide is specific to the constructed-response test, detailing the correct answers and the criteria for evaluating student responses.
- ## [Test question](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/TEST%20QUESTIONS.docx)
This contains questions for both the constructed-response test and the multiple-choice test, serving as the primary testing material for the students.

In addition to the aforementioned resources, students were also directed to an external platform to assess their intellectual quotient, named "[Test IQ](https://brght.org/)".
# Procedure:
1. Information Approach: We presented students with a structured method to assimilate and understand the provided information.
2. Examination Phase: After the learning phase, students were subjected to examinations to evaluate their grasp of the material.
3. Evaluation: Test results were collected and evaluated. Notably, the evaluation was done anonymously; the evaluators were unaware of the students' learning approaches, ensuring unbiased marking.
4. Data Compilation: Results were systematically tabulated into an Excel spreadsheet, which subsequently aided in report generation.
