# Exploring the Application of Generative AI (ChatGPT) in High School Mathematics Education within the Vietnamese Context

This document presents an overview of the various files and materials used during our study. We categorized students into three distinct groups to examine the efficacy of different learning approaches.
* ## [Probability rules](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/PROBABILITY%20RULES.docx)
This is a document for all three research groups to study. The content within this document includes theories on operations on sets, rules for calculating probabilities, and examples and exercises categorized according to Bloom's cognitive taxonomy.
- ## [Matrix](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/Matrix.docx)
The map describes the contents of the assessment test and is categorized according to the levels of Bloom's cognitive taxonomy. The purpose of this matrix is to help us create a post-assessment test (post-test).
- ## [Test answer key](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/TEST%20ANSWER%20KEY.docx)
The content in this file includes an answer key for the 20 multiple-choice questions and a scoring guide for the essay questions.
- ## [Test question](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/TEST%20QUESTIONS.docx)
This is a post-assessment test (post-test) constructed based on a descriptive matrix, consisting of 20 multiple-choice questions and 4 essay questions.
- ## [Test](https://github.com/Kane-Nguyen/research/blob/main/TEST.docx)
This is a pre-assessment test (pre-test) to be taken before conducting the research, comprising 10 multiple-choice questions., named "[Test IQ](https://brght.org/)".
# Procedure:
1. Information Approach: We presented students with a structured method to assimilate and understand the provided information.
2. Examination Phase: After the learning phase, students were subjected to examinations to evaluate their grasp of the material.
3. Evaluation: Test results were collected and evaluated. Notably, the evaluation was done anonymously; the evaluators were unaware of the students' learning approaches, ensuring unbiased marking.
4. Data Compilation: Results were systematically tabulated into an Excel spreadsheet, which subsequently aided in report generation.
